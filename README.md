# tutorial-react-auth0

This project has been built alongside the [Simple React.js User Login Authentication | Auth0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqczHS3Z2bc) on YouTube by codeSTACKr

This was an oppootunity to work with React and Auth0 and to also [water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/). I can use what I've learnt here in my new project **Nobelium** (WIP) - a quiz authoring, session management and delivery platform.

## Example

The project only has two views/actions: Login, and a profile view with a logout button:

![Login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12170473/96110301-937afb00-0ed7-11eb-8a74-1da081972bba.png)

![Profile/Logout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12170473/96110519-e18ffe80-0ed7-11eb-93a1-e6e9741ccc66.png)

From here, I can use this as a skeleton for building out a more complicated application with React and Auth0.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
